[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Hydra  is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. New modules are easy to
       add, beside that, it is flexible and very fast.

       This tool gives researchers and security consultants the possibility to show how easy it would be  to  gain
       unauthorized access from remote to a system.

       Currently this tool supports:
              adam6500   afp   asterisk   cisco   cisco‚Äêenable   cvs  firebird  ftp  ftps  http[s]‚Äê{head|get|post}
              http[s]‚Äê{get|post}‚Äêform http‚Äêproxy http‚Äêproxy‚Äêurlenum  icq  imap[s]  irc  ldap2[s]  ldap3[‚Äê{cram|di‚Äê
              gest}md5][s]  mssql  mysql(v4)  mysql5  ncp  nntp oracle oracle‚Äêlistener oracle‚Äêsid pcanywhere pcnfs
              pop3[s] postgres rdp radmin2 redis rexec rlogin rpcap rsh rtsp s7‚Äê300 sapr3 sip  smb  smtp[s]  smtp‚Äê
              enum snmp socks5 ssh sshkey svn teamspeak telnet[s] vmauthd vnc xmpp

       For  most  protocols  SSL is supported (e.g. https‚Äêget, ftp‚Äêssl, etc.).  If not all necessary libraries are
       found during compile time, your available services will be less.  Type "hydra" to see what is available.

[1mOptions[0m

       [1mOPTIONAL SERVICE PARAMETER[0m
              Some modules have optional or mandatory options. type "hydra -U <servicename>"
               to get help on on the options of a service.

       [1m-l LOGIN[0m

       [1m-p PASS[0m
              or -P FILE try password PASS, or load several passwords from FILE

       [1m-x min:max:charset[0m
              generate passwords from min to max length. charset can contain 1
               for numbers, a for lowcase and A for upcase characters.
               Any other character is added is put to the list.
                 Example: 1:2:a1%.
                 The generated passwords will be of length 1 to 2 and contain
                 lowcase letters, numbers and/or percent signs and dots.

       [1m-y     [22mdisable use of symbols in -x bruteforce, see above

       [1m-C FILE[0m
              colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of -L/-P options

       [1m-u     [22mby default Hydra checks all passwords for one login and then tries the next login. This option loops
              around the passwords, so the first password is tried on all logins, then the next password.

       [1m-b FORMAT[0m
              specify the format for the -o FILE: text(default), json, jsonv1

       [1m-W TIME[0m
              defines  a wait time between each connection a task performs. This usually only makes sense if a low
              task number is used, .e.g -t 1

       [1m-c TIME[0m
              the wait time in seconds per login attempt over all threads (‚Äêt 1 is recommended) This usually  only
